# Logs Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project was created following a prompt given for Udacity’s Full-Stack Nanodegree Program. The project requires students to use PostgreSQL and Python to query a large news database. Students must answer the following three questions with this project:
1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? 
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?


## Requirements 
Git
Python 3
PostgreSQL
Vagrant
VirtualBox

## Create Views
Two PSQL views were created to complete the query in question #3. **ENSURE THAT VIEWS ARE CREATED BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT (logsAnalysis.py )**
#First View : 
create view countPerDay select count(*) as numPerDay, date(time) as date from log group by date;

#Second View:
create view errorPerDay as select count(*) as numErrorPerDay, date(time) as date from log where status!='200 OK' group by date;

## Run Program
Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
Install Python 3
Install Udacity folder with Vagrant settings
Download the news database
Open Udacity folder
Launch virtual machine by using vagrant up command
Use vagrant ssh to ssh into virtual machine
Open vagrant folder
Load the database with psql -d news -f newsdata.sql
Run the database with psql -d news
Create views (further instructions in previous “Create Views” section)
Run file with command python logsAnalysis.py to fetch appropriate query results
